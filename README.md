# MTTPhoneNotes

This project was designed for Monmouth Telecom. Assisting new employees into how things are ran.

This website allows new employees to easily access the most used websites, and an easy to use phone call login system. This system allows them to know what to ask, write it down easily, and save it for future studying of that type of call.
